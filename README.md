  * Creating the best possible insurance tethered to the indivual and making insurance a social good instead of the "necessary evil" as said in thier mission statement.
  
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

  * Lower Income individuals but not limited to everyone. They seem to offer things for even people of higher incomes, for instance, in their car insurance offerings they offer discounts to individuals with electric vehicles which are typically a higher income item. 
  
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

   * One thing that this company can offer that their competeitors cannot is that an AI bot reviews your policy and returns the approval in as little as ninety seconds. They also are fast and do not require aany paperwork when it comes to paying claims. 
   
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

   * Lemonade uses AI and Big Data  to issue insurance policies. It categorizes customers in relevant risk groups and quotes a premium accordingly. Over time, the algorithms get better at grouping users that share a similar risk profile. As more data accumulates, recursive risk patterns emerge which enabling more precise grouping.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  * The impact of this company so far is that many low-middle class income earners are now able to have Car, Homeowners, Renters, Life and Pet insurance so an extremely afford able price.
  
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

  * Customer Satisfaction and the ability to raise capital. In these metrics, they do significantly well condisering the Lemonade website has hundreds of positive company reviews. In addition, the company's total stockholder's equity increased nearly 83%.
  
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

  * Relative to its competitors, Lemonade is performing quite similarly if not better than its comeptitors. Since the Insurtech industry is a relatively new one with a lot of R&D invesment, nearly none of them have been able o turn a profit yet. I would say its quite similar to Uber's performance at the beginning of the companies devlopment. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  *  If I were to advise Lemonade to do anything it would be the fact that they need to sell themselves more. I had no idea a company like this existed but as I'm watching sports I am exposed to GEICO, PROGRESSIVE and STATEFARM constantly. So what I would say is that Lemonade needs to gain further exposure to middle to lower class Americans in order to sell their product. As far as the products go, I think their on the right track to compete with the big insurance companies liek the ones previosuly mentioned because they offer pretty much every insurnace the typical consumer buys. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  * I think a big marketing campaign would benefit the company because it seems that the company's services and products they want to offer are all out their, and now they need to concern themselves with turning a profit in the next 5-10 years. So I believe if they attach big names and run these commercials on social media outlets, during sporting events and etc. they should be able to get the exposure they need.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  * Improvement of AI and Data usage in order to find the cheapest and most quality way to reach the lower to middle class population. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  * These technologies are appropriate for my solution because the company needs to tunr a profit with all of these R&D expenses going in, and that means if they are going to start a marketing campaign on a tight budget, they needs to figure out using Big Data where they can scrape every penny.
